# PINN_for_quantum_wavefunction_surfaces

The code used in the paper "First principles physics-informed neural network for quantum wavefunctions and eigenvalue surfaces"  arXiv:2211.04607

The default device is GPU so this code runs only on GPUs. To run on CPU the code needs to be modified. 

For analysis purposes you can load the pre-trained models (saved in "models" directory).
